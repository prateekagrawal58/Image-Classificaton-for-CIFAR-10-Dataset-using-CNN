The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 

Problem Definition:
Building an Image Classification project with CIFAR 10 Dataset
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) 
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model. 
We have 10 class of images:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
